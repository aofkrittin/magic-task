**Instruction**

- The file "magic.py" contains the class for running the solution for task A and B.

- If you run "magic.py", the IDE will assume that you are using "A.mp4" as an input.

- Run "B.py" for a result for video B.

**Assumptions**
- The camera spec is outputting 25 frames per second, as indicated in the video file.
- The parameters min_threshold and max_threshold are assumed to be 35 and 55 respectively. This comes from a pure observation from the result produced by using the video A.mp4

**Reasoning**
